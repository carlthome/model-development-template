# Model Development Template
This is a git repo template for creating new ML models within Jupyter Notebooks and/or VS Code.

## Features
- Development container oriented
- Jupyter Notebook oriented
- A basic Python package structure is included for migrating reusable code out of notebooks

## Delimitations
- This is not for automated model training. The design focus is on interactive development of new algorithms.
- The idea is not to use the latest and coolest technologies, but rather to keep things fairly standard and boring such that the focus remains on modelling.
